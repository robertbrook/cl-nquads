**CL-NTRIPLES** provides a simple parser for the N-Triples data format
as defined by the W3C for storing RDF/Semantic information. N-Triples
is a line-based, plain text format for encoding an RDF graph.

Main entry function is `PARSE-NT` method that parses N-Triples from
the given source. This method accepts a file pathname, an input
stream, or a string.

Returns a list of triples consisting of three elements: subject,
predicate, object. Subjects can be either an `uriref` or a
`nodeID`. Objects can be of three types: `uriref`, `nodeID` or a
`literal`. Depending on the type of the object it is encoded into an
association list.

N-Triples data format standard definition is provided in the W3C documents:
